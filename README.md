# WOW – The World of Words Game

Core Game
Input:

-   You are given a list of valid words (one word per line) in a file. This is your reference list (dictionary).
-   Display a 6 letter word (from a given dictionary) JUMBLED (mixed up) –
    For example ORANGE jumbled as AEGNOR
-   Start a timer (for 2 minutes)
-   The user can type any 3,4,5,6 letter words using exactly the same letters in the original word - AGE, NOR, RANGE, GORE, GEAR, RAGE etc.
-   As the user types each letter, it is removed from the original display so that the user knows what letters are left. A backspace will put the letter back in the word

    Example:
    User types Modified Word  
     A EGNOR  
     G ENOR  
     E NOR  
     `backspace` ENOR
